# James - League Page Setup Instructions

## üèà Welcome to Gvegas Gridiron League Page Setup!

Hey James! This README will walk you through updating the league page with all the details for Gvegas Gridiron. You'll need to edit the `src/lib/utils/leagueInfo.js` file.

---

## üìù STEP 1: Update Front Page Content (Lines 8-17)

**File to edit:** `src/lib/utils/leagueInfo.js`

**Current location:** Lines 8-17 (look for `homepageText`)

### What to do:
Replace the placeholder text with your league's actual information. The content needs to be in **HTML format**.

### Example:
```javascript
export const homepageText = `
  <h2>G-Vegas Gridiron</h2>
  <p>Established in 2015 by our corrupt commissioner James Figo, aka the Golden Reaper.</p>
  <p>We're a 16-team dynasty league with epic draft weekends and legendary rivalries.</p>
  <p>Championship winners include Chuckles (2x) and our in-house legal counsel William Corncob Corbin.</p>
  <p>League dues: $10 per season</p>
  <p>Draft format: Live auction draft</p>
  <p>Playoffs: 8 teams, weeks 15-17</p>
`;
```

### HTML Tags you can use: (Or just use chatgpt like me)
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` - Headers
- `<p>` - Paragraphs

- `<em>` or `<i>` - Italic text

    author: "jfigueroa17" // This will link to James's manager profile
}
```

### Author naming tips:
- Use exact manager names from the managers array for automatic linking
